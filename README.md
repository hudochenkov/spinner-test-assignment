# Spinner Test Assignment

See how it works: 

## Requirements

When uploading files on https://wetransfer.com you see our famous progress spinner. It grows and grows as it spins around, showing the percentage in the centre.

Recreate the spinner as a re-usable web component (using the ES2015 syntax) and include start and end buttons that enable or disable the spinning.

Use React.
Write tests.
